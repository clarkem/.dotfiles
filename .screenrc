# Anything I don't describe is treated literally.
#
# %?          - Start of a conditional statement.
#  %F         - Use this part of the statement if the window has focus (i.e. it
#               is the only window or the currently active one).
#  %{-b bc}   - Turn off bold, blue foreground, cyan background.
# %:          - else
#  %{-b bb}   - Turn off bold, blue foreground, blue background (this obscures
#               the text on non-focused windows and just gives a blue line).
# %?          - End conditional statement.
#  %C         - time (hh:mm, leading space) in 12 hour format
#  %c         - time (hh:mm, leading space) in 24 hour format
#  %D         - Three-letter day-of-week appreviation
#  %M         - Three-letter month appreviation
#  %d         - Day of the month
#  %H         - hostname
#  %?         - Start of conditional statement.
#   %F        - Use this part of the statement if the window has focus.
#   %{+u wb}  - underlined, white foreground, blue background
#  %?         - End conditional (if not focused, text remaind blue on blue).
#    %L=      - truncation/padding point.  With the 'L' qualifier, basically
#               just acts as a reference point.  Further truncation/padding is
#               done relative to here, not the beginning of the string
#    %-Lw     - window list up to but not including the current window (-),
#               show window flags (L)
#    %45>     - truncation/padding marker; place this point about 45% of the
#               way into the display area (45)
#    %{+b by} - add bold (still underlined from before), blue foreground,
#               yellow background
#      %n     - number of the current window
#      %f     - flags for current window
#      %t     - title of current window
#    %{-}     - undo last color change (so now we're back to underlined white
#               on blue)  (technically, this is a pop; a second invocation
#               would drop things back to unadorned blue on cyan)
#    %+Lw     - window list from the next window on (-), show window flags (L)
#    %-0<     - truncation/padding point.  Place this point zero spaces (0)
#               from the right margin (-).

# window flags (from screen man page)
# Uses  the  message  line to display a list of all the windows.  Each window
# is listed by number with the name of process that has been started in the
# window (or its title);
# the current window is marked with a `*';
# the previous  window  is  marked with a `-'
# all the windows that are "logged in" are marked with a `$';
# a background window that  has  received  a  bell is marked with a `!';
# a background window that is being monitored and has had activity
#      occur  is  marked  with  an `@';
# a window which has output logging turned on is marked with `(L)';
# windows  occupied by  other users are marked with `&';
# windows in the zombie state are marked with `Z'.
# If this list is  too  long  to fit on the terminal's status line only
# the portion around the current window is displayed.

# xterm understands both im/ic and doesn't have a status line.
# Note: Do not specify im and ic in the real termcap/info file as
# some programs (e.g. vi) will not work anymore.
